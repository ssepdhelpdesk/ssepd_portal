To **completely remove the Git repository** that was initialized with `git init` inside your folder `/var/www/html/siep/SSEPD_REPO/ssepd_ngo_working_portal/the_full_application`, you simply need to **delete the `.git` folder** inside it.

Here’s the exact command to do that:

---

### 🧹 **Remove Git repository (de-initialize)**

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

📍 Run this **inside** the `the_full_application` folder:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/siep/SSEPD_REPO/ssepd_ngo_working_portal/the_full_application
rm -rf .git
```

---

### ✅ Confirm it’s removed

Run:

```bash
ls -a
```

If you **don’t see `.git`**, the Git repo has been fully removed.

You can also verify by running:

```bash
git status
```

It should now say:

```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

Let me know if you'd like to reinitialize it under a different path or want to structure your Git repo differently.


Great! You want to:

1. **Do development on your Windows 11 laptop**
2. **Push changes to GitHub**
3. **Automatically update your CentOS server at**
   `/var/www/html/siep/SSEPD_REPO/ssepd_ngo_working_portal` when code is pushed

Let me guide you step-by-step.

---

## 🧰 PART 1: Setup Git on your **Windows 11 Laptop**

### ✅ 1. Install Git for Windows

* Download: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* Install it with default settings.

Open **Git Bash** after installation (not CMD/PowerShell).

---

### ✅ 2. Configure Git on your laptop

In **Git Bash**, run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "ssepdhelpdesk"
git config --global user.email "ssepdhelpdesk@gmail.com"
```

---

### ✅ 3. Generate SSH key and add it to GitHub

In **Git Bash**:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ssepdhelpdesk@gmail.com"
```

Press Enter to all prompts (default location, no passphrase is fine).

Then run:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

**Copy the entire output**, and add it to GitHub:

* GitHub → Profile → **Settings**
* **SSH and GPG keys** → **New SSH Key**
* Title: `Windows Laptop`
* Paste the copied key → Save

Now test it:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see:

```
Hi ssepdhelpdesk! You've successfully authenticated...
```

---

## 🧰 PART 2: Clone the GitHub Repo to Your Windows Laptop

In **Git Bash**, choose a folder (e.g., Documents), then:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone git@github.com:ssepdhelpdesk/ssepd_ngo_working_portal.git
cd ssepd_ngo_working_portal
```

Now you can **do all your development here** — edit files, commit, push.

---

## 💾 PART 3: Do Development Work Locally

Example flow when editing code:

```bash
# Inside repo folder
git status                       # See changes
git add .                        # Add all changes
git commit -m "Your message"    # Commit
git push origin main            # Push to GitHub
```

---

## 🔁 PART 4: Auto-Update CentOS Server When You Push (Deploy via Pull)

Now you want the CentOS server to auto-update when you push.
Simplest way: **pull from GitHub manually or via script/cron.**

---

### ✅ Option A: Manual Git Pull on Server

On your CentOS server:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/siep/SSEPD_REPO/ssepd_ngo_working_portal
git pull origin main
```

Do this after every push from your laptop.

---

### ✅ Option B: Set Up Password-less Git Pull via SSH on Server

On CentOS server:

1. Make sure `.git` is initialized and connected to GitHub (as we did before)
2. Run this if it says “Permission denied” when pulling:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Then `git pull origin main` should work without issue.

---

### ✅ Option C (Advanced): Automate with GitHub Webhook + Deploy Script

You can set up a webhook from GitHub that triggers a script on your server to pull changes automatically. This requires:

* Public IP or domain on your server
* Web server listening to GitHub POST
* Secure deploy token or secret

Let me know if you want this, and I’ll guide you.

## ✅ Summary

| Task                          | Done        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Git installed on Windows      | ✅           |
| SSH key added to GitHub       | ✅           |
| GitHub repo cloned on Windows | ✅           |
| Git push from Windows         | ✅           |
| Git pull on CentOS            | ✅           |
| Automated sync (optional)     | 🔄 Optional |

Would you like me to write a **Windows batch script** or **Linux shell script** to help with push/pull automation?
